# pyPILOT
An implementation of the PILOT (Programmed Instruction Learning Or Teaching) language.

## What is PILOT?

A very simple interpreted language formalized in 1973, a predecessor to Logo, and the language which started my interest in programming.

## Why use it? 

Don't. This is purely a bucket-list project. I've never *exactly* implemented a language, and this likely won't be a repo of my finest code. 

## Then, why write it? 

Primarilly? Safer-at-Home, Covid-19, boredom, and avoiding the dishes. 

On a deeper level? Because it's crossed my mind repeatedly for years and *doing* it will stop me from saying, "You know, I've always wanted to write my own PILOT runtime, wouldn't that be fun this rainy weekend?" before I binge more Netflix. 

PILOT was magical to me at 6 or 7 years old. It's simple to understand and has minimal command names which make it easier on learners who type at rates approaching 10 words per hour. Added to which, ATARI's implementation came with a step by step course disguised as a cute book of cartoons.
